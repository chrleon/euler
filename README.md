# Euler
My attempts at solving problems at Project Euler

## js
How to run the files?
> node jsfile

## folders
There is a folder called wip. These are for attempts not yet solved. Solved problems will be moved into root, and have a 'solved' as part of printout. This way the solutions are only displayed when you actually run the programs.
